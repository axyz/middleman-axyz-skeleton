The axyz Middleman Skeleton
===========================

- golden ratio control modular scale, baseline, responsive grid system(susy)
- color palette based on solarized
- semantic approach:
	- erb layouts to preserve compatibility with raw html
	- scss styles to preserve raw css compatibility
	- susy uses semantic grids
	- jquery ui uses a semantic approach(not perfect, but fine)
	- markdown content (ideally it could be compatible with raw human writing)
- coffeescript for clientside scripts
